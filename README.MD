## Rules of the game
Players take turns filling in one of 3x3 grid gameboard, each using their own symbol of X or O. X always starts the game, placing their X on one cell. The objective of the game is placing X or O in three consecutive cells; horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The primary objective is placing your own symbol in those three cells, a secondary objective is, of course, hindering your opponent in placing their symbol in three consecutive cells.
